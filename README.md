## Bonjour! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate French tech enthusiast with a deep love for programming, cybersecurity, and all things IT. Python is my go-to language, but Iâ€™m currently diving into the world of Rust. In my free time, I enjoy tackling jeopardy-style CTF challenges to sharpen my skills on various platforms. I also love developping tools that help solve challenges or are generally useful in cybersecurity and everyday life.
